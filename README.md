# Domainify

Domainify is Phishing Domain Detector Engine which was developed as an end-to-end project under the open internship offered by [inueron](https://internship.ineuron.ai/project/board/Phishing-Domain-Detection/62445bb9ef23b90657e6db1b), Here we collect data from an open source repository and build a machine Learning model which tries to predict whether the domains are real or malicious using an user interface web application we built.

## Getting Started

Phishing stands for a fraudulent process, where an attacker tries to obtain sensitive information from the victim. Usually, these kinds of attacks are done via emails, text messages, or websites. Phishing websites, which are nowadays in a considerable rise, have the same look as legitimate sites. However, their backend is designed to collect sensitive information that is inputted by the victim. Discovering and detecting phishing websites has recently also gained the machine learning communityâ€™s attention, which has built the models and performed classifications of phishing websites.

Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.

The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.

### Prerequisites

Operating systems requirements for the program and other tools to run, test and push 
- Windows 10+
- Mac OS (10.15+)

### Installing

The Code is written in Python 3.10.4. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
